## Company Background

Lait Equitable, also known as Fair Milk, is a Swiss initiative aimed at providing fair compensation to milk producers, ensuring they receive a price that covers production costs, specifically 1 CHF per liter of milk. This initiative emerged in response to the challenging conditions facing Swiss dairy production, including plummeting milk prices that do not cover production costs. Through the cooperative "Lait Equitable," the initiative collects, processes, and distributes milk to various sales points, ensuring producers receive fair compensation.

Key Points:

-   Foundation: Addressing the dire situation of milk producers in Switzerland due to inadequate compensation.
-   Operation: Via the "Lait Equitable" cooperative, ensuring fair pay of 1 CHF per liter to producers.
-   Product Range: Includes milk and possibly other dairy products found in retail stores under the Faireswiss brand.
-   Membership: Open to all Swiss milk producers, including those specializing in cheese production, e.g., Gruy√®re.
