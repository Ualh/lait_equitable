# Conclusion

In our detailed exploration of the Lait Equitable dataset, which focuses on the ins and outs of fair trade milk production in Switzerland, we've uncovered some interesting insights and important considerations for both sustainable farming and fair payment methods. Despite these findings, it's important to note that the small size of our dataset has somewhat limited the strength of our conclusions

## Key Findings
### Price Trends

Both organic and conventional milk exhibit distinct pricing trends, with organic milk consistently commanding higher prices. This underscores the market's value perception of organic products.

- **Forecasting Models**: The SARIMA and Holt-Winters models provided robust future price predictions, revealing a stable to slightly increasing trend for organic milk prices, while conventional milk prices are expected to increase less
- **Sales Analysis**: The distribution analysis across different Manor store locations indicated strong variability in sales, highlighting areas with scope for strategic marketing and operational enhancements.
- **Pareto Analysis**: Applying the Pareto Principle revealed that approximately 33.3% of the locations accounted for nearly 80% of the total sales. This insight suggests a significant concentration of sales among a subset of stores, which is critical for targeted marketing and resource allocation strategies.

### Implications

- **Organic Milk Promotion**: The stable pricing forecast for organic milk could encourage more producers to adopt organic farming, supporting environmental sustainability and *potentially* enhancing income due to higher price points.
- **Tailored Marketing Strategies**: The variability in sales across locations suggests that Lait Equitable could potentially benefit from a more tailored regional marketing strategy, possibly adapting product offerings based on regional preferences and sales performance.
- **Focused Resource Allocation**: Insights from the Pareto analysis allow for optimized resource allocation, focusing efforts on high-performing locations to maximize returns and implementing targeted improvements in underperforming areas or drop them could be a strategic move to consider.

## Limitations and Future Research

- **Significant Data Limitations**: A major limitation of our study is the small size of the dataset, which made extracting statistically significant results almost a mission impossible. This constraint has potentially skewed the accuracy of our findings
and forecasting models, leading to less confidence in the predictability of future trends based on this data alone.
- **Data Scope**: Additionally, the focus on relatively short-term data for forecasting could be expanded in future studies to refine predictions and adjust for market shocks.
- **Manor Sales Dataset**: Further research could delve deeper into a Manor sales dataset which could be highly beneficial in order to compare our products with other product in the Manor store. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the market dynamics and competitive landscape. Unfortunately, this data was not available for our analysis.
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Future research could also explore incorporating sustainability metrics into the analysis, such as carbon footprint or water usage, to provide a more holistic view of the environmental impact of different milk production methods.


## Take-Home Message

Lait Equitable stands as an interesting initiative in promoting fair compensation in the dairy industry. Despite the significant challenges posed by the limited dataset, our findings provide a foundation for understanding market dynamics and highlight areas for operational improvement. Continuing to leverage data-driven approaches, through a larger and more comprehensive dataset, will be really insightful for Lait Equitable to enhance its strategies and ensure the sustainability and profitability of Swiss dairy farmers. Future endeavors could also explore expanding product lines or new markets based on more robust data analyses, always with a focus on sustainable and equitable practices.
