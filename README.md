# Lait Equitable Analysis Project README

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the student project aimed at analyzing Lait Equitable, a cooperative initiative in Switzerland dedicated to ensuring fair compensation for milk producers. The project focuses on analyzing sales across different Manor locations, examining the price disparities between conventional and organic milk, and understanding the demand and supply dynamics in the market. Furthermore, it explores the development of organic milk demand over recent years and the factors influencing this trend.

## Company Background

Lait Equitable, also known as Fair Milk, is a Swiss initiative aimed at providing fair compensation to milk producers, ensuring they receive a price that covers production costs, specifically 1 CHF per liter of milk. This initiative emerged in response to the challenging conditions facing Swiss dairy production, including plummeting milk prices that do not cover production costs. Through the cooperative "Lait Equitable," the initiative collects, processes, and distributes milk to various sales points, ensuring producers receive fair compensation.

### Key Points:
- **Foundation:** Addressing the dire situation of milk producers in Switzerland due to inadequate compensation.
- **Operation:** Via the "Lait Equitable" cooperative, ensuring fair pay of 1 CHF per liter to producers.
- **Product Range:** Includes milk and possibly other dairy products found in retail stores under the Faireswiss brand.
- **Membership:** Open to all Swiss milk producers, including those specializing in cheese production, e.g., Gruyère.

## Project Goals

1. **Sales Analysis Across Manors:** To determine the factors contributing to the success of Lait Equitable's milk in some Manor stores but not in others.
2. **Price Differences:** To analyze the price differences between conventional and organic milk and their impact on market demand and supply.
3. **Demand for Organic Milk:** To study how the demand for organic milk has evolved in recent years and identify the driving factors behind this trend.

## Methodology

The project will employ a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including:
- Data collection on sales figures across different Manor locations.
- Market analysis to identify price disparities between conventional and organic milk.
- Literature review and trend analysis to understand the factors influencing the demand for organic milk.
